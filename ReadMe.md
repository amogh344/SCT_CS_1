Here’s an updated version of the README with properly formatted code blocks:

Caesar Cipher Program

This program implements a Caesar Cipher, which is a type of substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted by a certain number of positions down or up the alphabet.

How It Works

The program allows the user to:

	•	Encrypt a message by shifting its characters by a user-defined number (shift value).
	•	Decrypt an encrypted message by reversing the shift using the same value.

Features:

	•	Both uppercase and lowercase letters are supported.
	•	Non-alphabetic characters (e.g., spaces, numbers, punctuation) remain unchanged.
	•	The user can choose to encrypt or decrypt a message or quit the program.

Usage

	1.	Menu Options:
	•	e: Encrypt a message
	•	d: Decrypt a message
	•	q: Quit the program
	2.	Shift Value:
	•	The shift value must be a number between 0 and 25.
	•	This defines how many positions the alphabet is shifted.
	3.	Input Message:
	•	The user will enter a message, and the program will process it by either shifting the characters forward (for encryption) or backward (for decryption).

Example

	•	Encrypting the message “HELLO” with a shift value of 3:
	•	Encrypted Message: KHOOR
	•	Decrypting the message “KHOOR” with a shift value of 3:
	•	Decrypted Message: HELLO

How to Run
1.	Compile the program using a C compiler, for example:

		gcc caesar_cipher.c -o caesar_cipher


2.	Run the compiled program:

		./caesar_cipher


3.	Follow the on-screen instructions to enter the message, shift value, and desired operation (encrypt or decrypt).

This README now includes proper code block formatting for easier readability.
